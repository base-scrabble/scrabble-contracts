# Base Scrabble Contracts API

## Overview
This project provides a robust suite of Solidity smart contracts designed to power a decentralized Scrabble game ecosystem, managing player wallets, game state, and secure result settlements using EIP-712 signatures, built with Foundry and OpenZeppelin. üé≤

## Features
- **Solidity**: Implements on-chain game mechanics, financial logic, and secure state management for the Scrabble game.
- **Foundry**: Utilized as a comprehensive framework for smart contract development, facilitating efficient building, testing, and deployment.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: Integrates battle-tested libraries for secure access control, pausing mechanisms, and reentrancy protection.
- **Chainlink Price Feeds**: Leverages decentralized oracles for reliable, real-time ETH/USD price conversions within the Wallet contract.
- **EIP-712 Signatures**: Implements structured data hashing and signing to ensure secure off-chain authentication for user actions and authorized game result submissions.
- **AccessManager**: Centralized module providing granular role-based access control, KYC status tracking, address blacklisting, and property-specific permissions.
- **Multi-Token Wallet**: Manages user balances for native ETH, USDT, and USDC, handling deposits, withdrawals, and game staking operations.

### Environment Variables
For successful deployment and interaction with the contracts, the following environment variables or configuration parameters are typically required. These are passed to deployment scripts or configured within your Foundry environment.

- `RPC_URL`: The endpoint URL for your target blockchain network (e.g., Infura, Alchemy URL for Ethereum, Polygon, etc.).
  - Example: `RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID"`
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the Ethereum account designated to deploy contracts and send transactions. **Caution: Handle this key with extreme security, especially in production environments.**
  - Example: `PRIVATE_KEY="0x...your_deployer_private_key..."`
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: An API key for Etherscan or a compatible block explorer, used for automated contract verification after deployment.
  - Example: `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"`
- `CHAINLINK_ETH_USD_PRICE_FEED`: The contract address of the Chainlink ETH/USD price feed (`AggregatorV3Interface`) on your chosen blockchain network.
  - Example: `CHAINLINK_ETH_USD_PRICE_FEED="0x694AA1769357215Ee4EfB405d263a54d217d235E"` (Example for Sepolia Testnet)
- `USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The ERC20 contract address for the Tether (USDT) token on the target network.
  - Example: `USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS="0x...usdt_contract_address..."`
- `USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The ERC20 contract address for the USD Coin (USDC) token on the target network.
  - Example: `USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS="0x...usdc_contract_address..."`
- `SUPER_ADMIN_ADDRESS`: The initial Ethereum address to be granted the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `ADMIN_ROLE` within the `AccessManager` contract upon deployment.
  - Example: `SUPER_ADMIN_ADDRESS="0x...your_admin_wallet_address..."`
- `BACKEND_SIGNER_ADDRESS`: The Ethereum address of the trusted backend service responsible for generating and signing EIP-712 messages for user authentication.
  - Example: `BACKEND_SIGNER_ADDRESS="0x...your_backend_signing_wallet_address..."`
- `GAME_SUBMITTER_ADDRESS`: The Ethereum address that is authorized to submit final game results to the `Scrabble` contract. This is typically an address controlled by a centralized game server or oracle.
  - Example: `GAME_SUBMITTER_ADDRESS="0x...your_game_submitter_address..."`

## API Documentation

## Usage
Interacting with the Base Scrabble Contracts primarily involves sending transactions to the deployed contract addresses on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain. For a seamless user experience, a DApp frontend or a dedicated backend service typically handles these interactions on behalf of users.

### Typical Interaction Flow:
1.  **Fund Wallet**: Users typically begin by depositing native ETH or supported ERC20 tokens (USDT, USDC) into their personal balance held by the `Wallet` contract. These deposit actions require an EIP-712 signature from a trusted backend signer to ensure that only authenticated user requests are processed.
2.  **Create Game**: A player can initiate a new Scrabble game by calling `Scrabble.createGame()`, specifying a stake amount and the desired token. The `Scrabble` contract, having been authorized, then interacts with the `Wallet` contract to deduct the stake from the player's balance. This step also requires a backend signature for player authentication.
3.  **Join Game**: Other players can join an existing game by calling `Scrabble.joinGame()`, ensuring their stake amount exactly matches that of the game creator. Similar to game creation, funds are deducted via the `Wallet` contract, and backend authentication is required.
4.  **Game Settlement**: Once a game concludes off-chain (after players have completed their turns and agreed upon a result), an authorized game submitter (usually a centralized backend service or oracle) calls `Scrabble.submitResult()`. This function validates the outcome, updates player scores, and securely credits the total prize pot to the winner's `Wallet` balance (or refunds all players in the event of a draw).
5.  **Withdraw Funds**: Users can at any time withdraw their ETH or ERC20 tokens from the `Wallet` contract back to their external blockchain address by calling `Wallet.withdrawETH()` or `Wallet.withdrawToken()`, with each withdrawal also requiring a backend signature for authentication.

### Example Interaction (Conceptual using `ethers.js`):
The following conceptual code snippets illustrate how a DApp or backend might interact with the contracts.
(Note: Replace placeholders like `WALLET_ABI`, `SCRABBLE_ABI`, `USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS`, etc., with actual values.)

**1. Approve USDT for Wallet (required before ERC20 deposit):**
Before a user can `depositToken`, they must first grant the `Wallet` contract an allowance to spend their USDT tokens by calling `approve` on the USDT ERC20 contract.
```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// Assume provider and signer are initialized
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("YOUR_RPC_URL");
const signer = new ethers.Wallet("YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY", provider); // User's wallet

const USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x...deployed_usdt_address...";
const WALLET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x...deployed_wallet_address...";
const ERC20_ABI = ["function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) returns (bool)"];

const usdtContract = new ethers.Contract(USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, signer);
const amountToApprove = ethers.parseUnits("100", 6); // Example: 100 USDT with 6 decimals

console.log("Approving Wallet to spend USDT...");
const tx = await usdtContract.approve(WALLET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, amountToApprove);
await tx.wait();
console.log("Approval successful:", tx.hash);
```

**2. Deposit USDT to Wallet (requires backend signature):**
The backend service would generate an EIP-712 signature (`backendSig`) for `msg.sender` (the user performing the deposit).
```javascript
// This part conceptually shows the backend's role in signing.
// In a real application, the backend would expose an API endpoint for this.
async function getBackendSignature(userAddress, verifyingContractAddress, backendSignerPrivateKey) {
    const domain = {
        name: "Wallet",
        version: "1",
        chainId: 11155111, // Example: Sepolia Chain ID
        verifyingContract: verifyingContractAddress,
    };
    const types = {
        Auth: [{ name: "player", type: "address" }],
    };
    const value = {
        player: userAddress,
    };

    const backendSigner = new ethers.Wallet(backendSignerPrivateKey);
    const signature = await backendSigner.signTypedData(domain, types, value);
    return signature;
}

// Frontend (or direct contract interaction)
const WALLET_ABI = ["function depositToken(address token, uint256 amount, bytes calldata backendSig)"]; // Simplified ABI
const userAddress = signer.address;
const amountToDeposit = ethers.parseUnits("50", 6); // 50 USDT

// Assume backend_signer_private_key is securely available on the backend
const backendSig = await getBackendSignature(userAddress, WALLET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, "0x...backend_signer_private_key...");

const walletContract = new ethers.Contract(WALLET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, WALLET_ABI, signer);
console.log("Depositing USDT to Wallet...");
const depositTx = await walletContract.depositToken(USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS, amountToDeposit, backendSig);
await depositTx.wait();
console.log("Deposit successful:", depositTx.hash);
```

**3. Create a Scrabble Game (requires backend signature):**
Similarly, a backend signature is required for a user to create a game.
```javascript
const SCRABBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x...deployed_scrabble_address...";
const SCRABBLE_ABI = ["function createGame(uint256 stakeAmount, address token, bytes calldata backendSig) returns (uint256)"]; // Simplified ABI

const scrabbleContract = new ethers.Contract(SCRABBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, SCRABBLE_ABI, signer);

const stake = ethers.parseUnits("10", 6); // 10 USDT stake for the game

// Reuse the Auth signature type, adjusted for Scrabble contract context
async function getGameBackendSignature(userAddress, verifyingContractAddress, backendSignerPrivateKey) {
    const domain = {
        name: "Scrabble", // Contract name for EIP-712 domain
        version: "1",
        chainId: 11155111, // Example: Sepolia Chain ID
        verifyingContract: verifyingContractAddress,
    };
    const types = {
        Auth: [{ name: "player", type: "address" }],
    };
    const value = {
        player: userAddress,
    };
    const backendSigner = new ethers.Wallet(backendSignerPrivateKey);
    const signature = await backendSigner.signTypedData(domain, types, value);
    return signature;
}

const gameBackendSig = await getGameBackendSignature(userAddress, SCRABBLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, "0x...backend_signer_private_key...");

console.log("Creating Scrabble game...");
const createGameTx = await scrabbleContract.createGame(stake, USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS, gameBackendSig);
const receipt = await createGameTx.wait();
console.log("Game created. Transaction hash:", receipt.hash);
// Parse event to get gameId if needed
```
